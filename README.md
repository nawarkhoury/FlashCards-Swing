# FlashCards-Swing
Vocabulary memorizing tool for language learning. Built in Java Swing and SQLite.

# How can this project be useful?
 - If you are learning a language and want to have a cool flashcards program.
 - if you are learning about java swing (I wouldn't recommend it, really, just learn react and electron and angular and other cooler technologies).
 - if you are looking for some example of a simple java MVC application.
